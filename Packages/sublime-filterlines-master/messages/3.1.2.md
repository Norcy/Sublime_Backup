#3.1.2  May 20, 2018

This release is for Sublime Text 3 users. I have separate versions of the plugin for Sublime Text 2 and 3, and the version for Sublime Text 2 remains unchanged for now.

##Changes

- Added install instructions

##Regular Expression Syntax
Earlier releases used Python regular expression syntax. This release uses Sublime Text search, which implements the Perl regular expression syntax from the Boost library. For more on the Boost Perl syntax, see:
