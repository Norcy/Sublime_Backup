3.1.0  April 10, 2017
----------------------

This release is for Sublime Text 3 users. I have separate versions of the plugin for Sublime Text 2 and 3, and the version for Sublime Text 2 remains unchanged for now.

Changes
-------
- Folding is faster
- Filtering in place is back!
- New menus on the Edit > Lines and Edit > Code Folding menus, and in package manager

Regular Expression Syntax
-------------------------
Earlier releases used Python regular expression syntax. This release uses Sublime Text search, which implements the Perl regular expression syntax from the Boost library. For more on the Boost Perl syntax, see:
